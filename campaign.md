**CAPITAL CAMPAIGN GIVING**

The board of the Xi SAM/Fenway Alumni Corporation is starting a Capital
Campaign to raise \$100,000 to help cover essential work done at 34 the
Fenway. We have pledged to match the first \$30,000 in donations and we
hope that you will give through one of these ways:

1.  Donate online to the Capital Campaign through our Zeffy campaign
    page
    (<https://www.zeffy.com/en-US/donation-form/fenway-capital-campaign--2025>).

2.  Send a check made out to Xi SAM/Fenway Alumni Corporation to: Xi
    SAM/Fenway Alumni Corporation; c/o Marc Tanner, Treasurer; 7 Spencer
    Ave; Somerville MA 02144

3.  Donate to the IRDF fund (<https://giving.mit.edu/irdf>) to help
    repay our IRDF loan for the fire alarm system. Before doing that,
    please make sure your Infinite Connection profile lists either
    Fenway House or Sigma Alpha Mu so the donation is credited to us! We
    also ask that you let us know that you are donating to the IRDF on
    our behalf by filling out this simple form:
    <https://forms.gle/HfGCqXaxE4WP7Tpg6>

**Notes:**

Donations to the IRDF are tax deductible to the extent permitted by law.
90% of your IRDF donation will be applied to our loan; 10% will be
retained by the IRDF to support their projects (grants, loans) for
independent living groups in general. Donations to the Alumni
Corporation are **not** generally tax deductible, as we are a 501(c)7
non-profit (this may vary for state taxes depending on your state's tax
code).

To set your living group in your Profile: Log onto the Infinite
Connection (https://alum.mit.edu/login), go to the My Account dropdown
at the upper right and select Edit Profile. Then pick the MIT tab
(between Work and Volunteer) and scroll down to Living Groups. If there
is nothing listed (or it is wrong), click the pencil icon and you can
select Fenway House or Sigma Alpha Mu from the drop-down menu. You may
have multiple living groups listed, which is fine; by filling out the
form to let us know of your donation, we'll be able to notify the IRDF
that the donation is meant for us.
